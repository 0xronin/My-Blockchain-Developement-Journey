# My-Blockchain-Development-Journey-2022


In this program, I'm going to teach myself how to code and build 
production-ready dapps through free resources available on the internet.

The Program structure will be Day-wise with the following folders- 

* **Code** of programs I've written that day
* **Notes** on codes covered that day
* **Side Reading** (research papers/books/articles/videos/podcasts) that I've gone through that day



*Will document everything in this Repo.*
